name: vspec-feature
description: Complete V-Model specification-driven development from ATDD to production code. Creates hierarchical test structure from user stories.

I'll develop this feature using V-Model methodology with the vmodel-orchestrator agent.

## Starting V-Model Development

**Feature**: $ARGUMENTS

I'll create a complete ATDD → SDD → TDD hierarchical development workflow for this feature, including:

1. **ATDD Phase**: Convert your user story into Gherkin acceptance test scenarios
2. **SDD Phase**: Decompose into system design specifications
3. **TDD Phase**: Implement each component with test-first development
4. **Validation**: Bottom-up verification of the complete V-Model

Let me begin by using the vmodel-orchestrator to coordinate this development process.

**Using vmodel-orchestrator for**: "$ARGUMENTS"

This will establish:
- ✓ Full requirement traceability
- ✓ Hierarchical test structure  
- ✓ Bidirectional consistency checking
- ✓ Complete test coverage from acceptance to unit level
